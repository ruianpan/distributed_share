This program is compiled with java IDE Intellij IDEA. To run this program without the IDE, go to the out/artifacts/mp2-jar folder and find the file mp2.jar. Put this file into the vm and run "java -jar mp2.jar 0", for the introducer vm, and "java -jar mp2.jar 1" for other ones. Important note is that, we coded vm1 to be the introducer vm, so you can only use 0 on that vm.
Once you are running multiple vms, you can start typing in commands. When you type in "join" in a non-introducer machine, it joins in the membership list. When you type "leav", it voluntarily leaves from the membership list. When you type "list", it lists the current membership-list, and when you type "id", it shows your own timestamp and ip.
Note that you cannot join the list if the introducer is down, but you can leave the list.
